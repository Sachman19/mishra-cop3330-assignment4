Solution (interface):
    From driver/main function, create menu to allow for different options

    from menu, allow creation of toDoList object
        prompt for title of toDoList.
        after creation, move to modification submenu
    from menu, allow modification of toDoList values through submenu
        from submenu, display title of toDoList in modifiable text box.
        from submenu, display items in list below desc/due date. Allow for filtering and addition/removal.
        from list, allow for modification of items
            modifiable text boxes for description/due date
            check box for completion status
    from menu, allow for saving/loading of toDoList to external storage.
        dropdown menu with options "all" and each list separately.

Solution (internal):
    from driver, create arrayList of toDoList objects.
    when prompted, create and initialize toDoList object in arrayList

    in toDoList object, create arraylist of item objects.
    allow for creation/deletion of items within toDoList. arrayList will take care of this.
    allow for modification of items within toDoList. Different methods in item class will take care of this.
